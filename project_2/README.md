This folder contains all of the files generated for ENGI 301 Project 2.

Attached you will find the mechanical block diagram I created, as well as the EAGLE files necessary to make changes to the schematics or board itself.
I also uploaded the .lbr that I created for the project. In addition, you will find the BOM file as a .csv and you will be able to access the 
manufacturing files necessary to manufacture this board under the MFG folder.
