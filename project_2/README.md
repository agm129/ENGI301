This folder contains all of the files generated for ENGI 301 Project 2.

ENGI 301 Project 2 consisted of designing a PCB board for an Etch-a-Sketch game. We used an Adafruit LCD display, a PocketBeagle, USB Host, and through-hole components such as LEDs, resistors and potentiometers to create the Etch-a-Sketch on a PCB. The PCB is exactly 4 inches by 5 inches in dimension to allow for maximum space between each component. 

Attached you will find the mechanical block diagram I created (in docs folder), as well as the EAGLE files necessary to make changes to the schematics or board itself (EAGLE folder).
I also uploaded the .lbr that I created for the project (EAGLE folder). In addition, you will find the BOM file as a .csv and you will be able to access the manufacturing files necessary to manufacture this board under the MFG folder.
