This code was developed as part of a project for ENGI 301. 

In this project, the goal was to develop a software model that would interface with a hardware model to successfully create a blue light disinfection 
system that would run by itself once the PocketBeagle booted up. 

The script is first meant to initialize the Hex Display and then wait for a button press. The moment that the button is pressed, a sequence of events will
ensue, all while the system records the time that the button was pressed. After the button is pressed, the camera connected to the PB will take a picture 
of an agar plate contaminated with bacteria and the system will compute the number of bacterial cultures present using openCV software. After the picture
is taken, the blue LEDs will be turned on and a 30 minute countdown will begin. Every so often, the display will update with the time left on the 
disinfection cycle and the system will once again take a picture of the contaminated agar plate and compute the number of bacterial cultures present 
using openCV. If the number of cultures calculated by the system is less than the threshold value, then the LEDs will be turned off and the Hex display 
will display "GOOD," and wait for a button press once again. If the number of cultures is above the threshold value, then the system will continue counting 
down and updating the display until the number of cultures is below the threshold value. 

In preparation for running or modifying code:

OpenCV requires certain dependencies to work with USB cameras. 
These must be installed prior to OpenCV software installation:
# libav video input/output development libraries
$ sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev
# Video4Linux camera development libraries
$ sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
# OpenGL development libraries (to allow creating graphical windows)
$ sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
# GTK development libraries (to allow creating graphical windows)
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
# Install the OpenCV python
$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv

Next, you must install the OpenCV software as follows: 
$ unzip opencv-3.4.1.zip
$ cd opencv-3.4.1
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D WITH_TBB=OFF -D BUILD_TBB=OFF -D WITH_V4L=ON -D WITH_LIBV4L=OFF -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D BUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF ..

However, since we will not be using a USB camera for now, we will only install 3 libraries to be able to run this code. Run the following commands:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
